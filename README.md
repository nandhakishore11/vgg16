# VGG 16 with Keras 2.0
fast.ai VGG 16 implementation with Keras 2.0
All the functions of vgg as taught by fast.ai will work.
This model uses TensorFlow backend. So dimension ordering is different from theano.
Download the weights of VGG in Keras 2.0 from https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-models/releases/download/v0.1/vgg16_weights_tf_dim_ordering_tf_kernels.h5
Change path variable accordingly.
